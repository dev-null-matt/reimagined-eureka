# Chapter 4: Demiplane of Dread

## Story Items
Once discovered by an adventuring party, these items are assumed to be carried by a specific member of the party but should be recorded as a story item on _all_ character's log sheets. They don't count against the character's magic item limit, but also cannot be used anywhere but in 04-HC.
* Holy Symbol of Ravenkind
* Icon of Ravenloft
* Statuette of Saint Markovia
* Sunsword
* Tome of Strahd

## Dark Gifts
### Alignment Change
Remember that characters who have their alignment changed to neutral evil or chaotic evil are forever barred from organized play and must be retired. Make sure any player bargaining with a dark vestige is explicitly reminded of this fact before they agree to a bargain.
### Leaving the Demiplane
The Dark Gifts granted by the powers are intrinsically tied to the Demiplane of Dread. A character who leaves the demiplane will be forever marked by their experiences there, but all mechanical benefits of a dark gift cease to function.
