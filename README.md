# What This Is
This is an attempt to create a living ruleset for organized play of the 5th Edition of the most popular role playing game on the planet.

## Reason
The current rule set for organized play, as published, in general doesn't achieve what the players want and not effort is made by those who write the rules to incoroprate feedback from the community.

## Why In Github
Github allows for several desirable features, namely:
* Easy collaboration
* Tracked changes
* Easy support for versioning
